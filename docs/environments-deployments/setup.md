# Initial Setup

## Description

Setting up new environments for testing and production purposes has always been hard. The struggle of setting them up and deploying them fast is a monumental effort to be made between developers and devops. As a solution, a builder was made to make it really easy for any team member to deploy custom environments.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account Keys
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installation
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installation
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/) installation
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installation
- Add all the files from the [environment-builder](https://github.com/kyanvasu/environment_builder) repository to the root of your Kanvas API project.

&nbsp;

## Setup AWS CLI

Before deploying your custom environment you need first setup your AWS Account and AWS CLI.

&nbsp;

### Download AWS CLI

Download the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and follow the necessary steps for the installation

&nbsp;
### AWS CLI Configuration Basics

For this step you will need your AWS Account Keys which can be created and retrieved from AWS IAM. The following link [Configuration basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) provides a detailed configuration process for AWS CLI using the keys mentioned before.

&nbsp;

### To change AWS CLI Profile

To change between AWS CLI profiles use the following commands:

#### Linux and Mac OS
``` sh 
export AWS_PROFILE=user1
```

#### Windows OS

```sh
setx AWS_PROFILE user1
```
**Notice:** the value of the user1 is the name of the AWS CLI Profile

&nbsp;

## Setup of the environment

### Creating the S3 bucket for the environment

An [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) should be created to store all you API environment variables in a file(the file should not have any extension). This file is later used by the Environment Builder at docker image creation. The bucket and the file storing the environment variables may have any name you like. Here is a basic example:

* **S3 Bucket Name**: sacrmapi
* **S3 Environment Variables Name**: developmentenv

***Note***: You could also add the environment variables file to a folder for a more organize bucket but later on in the `locals.tf` in the field `aws_env_s3_bucket_prefix_key` you have to specify the path to the file inside the folder.

### Changing the ```locals.tf``` file

The ```locals.tf``` file contains all the values for the environment builder with terraform. Change them as you like for your environment. Furthermore, is a brief description of every field:

* **eks_cluster_name** : 
    * description : Name of the Kubernetes Cluster in AWS EKS.
    * example : `crm-api`
* **eks_namespace_name** : 
    * description : Name of the Kubernetes environment namespace.
    * example : `development` or `staging` or whatever you like.
* **_k8s_service_account_name** : 
    * description : Name of the Kubernetes service account.
* **_k8s_service_account_autoscaler** : 
    * description : Name of the Kubernetes autoscaler account.
* **helm_chart_name** : 
    * description : Name of the Helm Chart in the Kubernetes Cluster.
    * example : `crm-api`
* **aws_ecr_repo_name** : 
    * description : Name of the AWS ECR repository.
    * example : `crm-api`
* **aws_ecr_image_tag** : 
    * description : Name of the tag for AWS ECR repository image.
    * example : `latest` or `develop`
* **aws_region** : 
    * description : AWS Region Name.
    * example : `us-east-1`
* **aws_account_id** : 
    * description : Your AWS Acccount Id.
    * example : `23445343455`
* **_aws_ecr_login_command** : 
    * description : Default AWS login command for Docker Login in AWS ECR.
* **_docker_tag_command** : values for pushing.
    * description : Default docker tag command to tag a docker image with AWS ECR 
* **_ecr_push_command** : 
    * description : Default AWS command to push a local docker image to AWS ECR.
* **_ecr_repo_uri** : 
    * description : AWS ECR Repository URI.
* **aws_env_s3_bucket_name** : 
    * description : AWS S3 bucket name where the environment values are stored.
    * example : `crmapi-cluster`
* **aws_env_s3_bucket_prefix_key** : 
    * description : AWS S3 bucket path to environment values file.
    * example : `/crm-api-dev/salesassist_dev` where `salesassist_dev` is the name of the file.

**Warning**: Fields prefixed with  `_`  should not be changed.

### Changing the ```values.yaml``` file

The ```values.yaml``` file contains all the values for the kubernetes pods and other resources. Change them as you like for your environment. Furthermore, is a brief description of every field:

#### General values
* namespace : Name of the namespace in the Kubernetes Cluster.
* apiImage : API Image used for the api and queue pods. This could be empty since the image is created when terraform runs.

#### PHP values
* memoryLimit : Memory limit for php fpm.

#### Services Values

* loadBalancer
    * name : Load Balancer Name
    * appName : The name of the app it belongs to in Kubernetes.
    * annotations : Any other options to add to the load balancer.
        * sslCert: ARN of a custom SSL Certificate in AWS.

#### Pods values

There are two sections here, one for the api and one for queues, each of them has their own values for their pods.

##### API pod values
* api :
    * name : Name of the pod
    * containerName : Name of the container inside de pod.

##### **Queue pods values**
* jobs :
    * name : Name of the jobs queue pod
    * containerName : Name of the container inside de pod.
* events :
    * name : Name of the events queue pod
    * containerName : Name of the container inside de pod.
* notifications :
    * name : Name of the notifications queue pod
    * containerName: Name of the container inside de pod.
* workflows : 
    * name : Name of the workflows queue pod
    * containerName : Name of the container inside de pod.
